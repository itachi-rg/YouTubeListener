# YouTubeListener

This app downloads the audio version of songs in your YouTube playlist.

Reasons for creating the app :

1) Lesser bandwidth consumption since only the audio file is downloaded, unlike the YouTube app which downloads the entire video.

2) Uninterrupted songs. The YouTube app stops playing videos when your phone screen locks or you switch apps. This app on the other hand lets you play the songs even if your screen locks.

3) Do not have to create new playlists. In case you switch to other music apps, then you may have to recreate your playlist of songs which are already present in YouTube.
